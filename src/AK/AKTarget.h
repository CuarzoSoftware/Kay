/**
 * @brief A rendering destination.
 *
 * A target encapsulates all the necessary information required for an `AKScene::render()` call.
 *
 * Targets are created using `AKScene::createTarget()` and are bound to a specific scene. They cannot be shared across scenes.
 *
 * In desktop applications, nodes are typically displayed within a single window. As such, one scene with a single target is usually sufficient per window.
 * However, in compositors, where nodes are displayed across multiple screens, a single scene is shared. A separate target is created for each screen, allowing nodes
 * to maintain their internal state independently for each screen. For instance, if damage is applied to a node and rendered to one target, the damage will only be
 * cleared for that specific target when rendered, leaving other targets unaffected.
 *
 * Targets must be destroyed on the same thread or context in which they were created, using `AKScene::destroyTarget()`. They are also automatically destroyed when the scene is destroyed.
 *
 * Destroying a target also frees all associated internal state for rendered nodes.
